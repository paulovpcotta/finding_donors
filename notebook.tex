\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Project: Finding Donors for
\emph{CharityML}}{Project: Finding Donors for CharityML}}\label{project-finding-donors-for-charityml}

    Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer
Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been
provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional
functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections
that begin with \textbf{'Implementation'} in the header indicate that
the following block of code will require additional functionality which
you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the
specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}TODO\textquotesingle{}} statement. Please be
sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must
answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section
where you will answer a question is preceded by a \textbf{'Question X'}
header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the
following text boxes that begin with \textbf{'Answer:'}. Your project
submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the
questions and the implementation you provide.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note:} Please specify WHICH VERSION OF PYTHON you are using when
submitting this notebook. Code and Markdown cells can be executed using
the \textbf{Shift + Enter} keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown
cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit
mode.
\end{quote}

    \subsection{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your
choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from
the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm
from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best
model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a
model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than
\$50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where
organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income
can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to
request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it
can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket
directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value
from other publically available features.

The dataset for this project originates from the
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income}{UCI Machine
Learning Repository}. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry
Becker, after being published in the article \emph{"Scaling Up the
Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"}. You can
find the article by Ron Kohavi
\href{https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf}{online}. The
data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original
dataset, such as removing the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}fnlwgt\textquotesingle{}} feature and records
with missing or ill-formatted entries.

\subsection{Exploring the Data}\label{exploring-the-data}

Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the
census data. Note that the last column from this dataset,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\textquotesingle{}}, will be our target
label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, \$50,000
annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the
census database.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Data
Exploration}\label{implementation-data-exploration}

A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many
individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage
of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below,
you will need to compute the following: - The total number of records,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}n\_records\textquotesingle{}} - The number of
individuals making more than \$50,000 annually,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}n\_greater\_50k\textquotesingle{}}. - The
number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}n\_at\_most\_50k\textquotesingle{}}. - The
percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}greater\_percent\textquotesingle{}}.

\textbf{Hint:} You may need to look at the table above to understand how
the \texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\textquotesingle{}} entries are
formatted.

\subsection{Preparing the Data}\label{preparing-the-data}

Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it
often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured --- this is typically
known as \textbf{preprocessing}. Fortunately, for this dataset, there
are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are
some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This
preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive
power of nearly all learning algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Transforming Skewed Continuous
Features}\label{transforming-skewed-continuous-features}

A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend
to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of
vastly larger or smaller values than that single number. Algorithms can
be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the
range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features
fit this description: '\texttt{capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}}.

Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note
the range of the values present and how they are distributed.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

        \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} Visualize skewed continuous features of original data}

    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{output_10_0.png}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    For highly-skewed feature distributions such as
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}}, it is common
practice to apply a logarithmic transformation on the data so that the
very large and very small values do not negatively affect the
performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation
significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must
be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of
\texttt{0} is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small
amount above \texttt{0} to apply the the logarithm successfully.

Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and
visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are
distributed.

    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    \subsubsection{Normalizing Numerical
Features}\label{normalizing-numerical-features}

In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly
skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on
numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the
shape of each feature's distribution (such as
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} or
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}} above);
however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when
applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied,
observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original
meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html}{\texttt{sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler}}
for this.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Data
Preprocessing}\label{implementation-data-preprocessing}

From the table in \textbf{Exploring the Data} above, we can see there
are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically,
learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that
non-numeric features (called \emph{categorical variables}) be converted.
One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the
\textbf{one-hot encoding} scheme. One-hot encoding creates a
\emph{"dummy"} variable for each possible category of each non-numeric
feature. For example, assume \texttt{someFeature} has three possible
entries: \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, or \texttt{C}. We then encode this
feature into \texttt{someFeature\_A}, \texttt{someFeature\_B} and
\texttt{someFeature\_C}.

~~\textbar{} someFeature \textbar{} \textbar{} someFeature\_A \textbar{}
someFeature\_B \textbar{} someFeature\_C \textbar{}\\
:-: \textbar{} :-: \textbar{} \textbar{} :-: \textbar{} :-: \textbar{}
:-: \textbar{}\\
0 \textbar{} B \textbar{} \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 1 \textbar{} 0
\textbar{}\\
1 \textbar{} C \textbar{} -\/-\/-\/-\textgreater{} one-hot encode
-\/-\/-\/-\textgreater{} \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 1
\textbar{}\\
2 \textbar{} A \textbar{} \textbar{} 1 \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 0
\textbar{}

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the
non-numeric target label,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\textquotesingle{}} to numerical values
for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible
categories for this label ("\textless{}=50K" and "\textgreater{}50K"),
we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two
categories as \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, respectively. In code cell
below, you will need to implement the following: - Use
\href{http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies\#pandas.get_dummies}{\texttt{pandas.get\_dummies()}}
to perform one-hot encoding on the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}features\_raw\textquotesingle{}} data. -
Convert the target label
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\_raw\textquotesingle{}} to numerical
entries. - Set records with "\textless{}=50K" to \texttt{0} and records
with "\textgreater{}50K" to \texttt{1}.

    \subsubsection{Shuffle and Split Data}\label{shuffle-and-split-data}

Now all \emph{categorical variables} have been converted into numerical
features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we
will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training
and test sets. 80\% of the data will be used for training and 20\% for
testing.

Run the code cell below to perform this split.

\subsection{Evaluating Model
Performance}\label{evaluating-model-performance}

In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and
determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms
will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is
known as a \emph{naive predictor}.

    \subsubsection{Metrics and the Naive
Predictor}\label{metrics-and-the-naive-predictor}

\emph{CharityML}, equipped with their research, knows individuals that
make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity.
Because of this, \emph{CharityML} is particularly interested in
predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that
using \textbf{accuracy} as a metric for evaluating a particular model's
performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that
\emph{does not} make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be
detrimental to \emph{CharityML}, since they are looking to find
individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely
predict those that make more than \$50,000 is \emph{more important} than
the model's ability to \textbf{recall} those individuals. We can use
\textbf{F-beta score} as a metric that considers both precision and
recall:

\[ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} \]

In particular, when \(\beta = 0.5\), more emphasis is placed on
precision. This is called the \textbf{F\(_{0.5}\) score} (or F-score for
simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000,
and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more
than \$50,000. This can greatly affect \textbf{accuracy}, since we could
simply say \emph{"this person does not make more than \$50,000"} and
generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a
statement would be called \textbf{naive}, since we have not considered
any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to
consider the \emph{naive prediction} for your data, to help establish a
benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using
that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less
than \$50,000, \emph{CharityML} would identify no one as donors.

    \subsubsection{Question 1 - Naive Predictor
Performace}\label{question-1---naive-predictor-performace}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than
  \$50,000, what would that model's accuracy and F-score be on this
  dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}accuracy\textquotesingle{}} and
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}fscore\textquotesingle{}} to be used later.
\end{itemize}

** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor
is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look
like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the
results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon
which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set,
getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start
from.

** HINT: **

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual
  makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or
  False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value)
  predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as
  our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as
  every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0'
  becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is
  the total number of records we have in total.
\item
  Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in
  this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.

\end{itemize}

** HINT: **

Structure your answer in the same format as above\^{}, with 4 parts for
each of the three models you pick. Please include references with your
answer.

    \textbf{Answer:} \textbf{Models:} In this case I believe it may be the
three models that I will be quoting below: \textbf{Gaussian Naive
Bayes}, the \textbf{Support Vector Machines (SVM)} and the
\textbf{Adaboost} joint method.

\textbf{What are the model's strengths?}

\textbf{Gaussian Naive Bayes:} has been widely used in the industry for
text classification purposes. In particular, to sort and filter spam
emails based on the probability that certain words appear in a spam
e-mail compared to a non-spam e-mail follows references taken from the
internet: (https: // machinelearningmastery. with /
naive-bayes-for-machine-learning /,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive\_Bayes\_classifier).

\textbf{Vector Support Machines (SVM):} have been used successfully in
the industry for manual digit identification at a level close to the
human classification error following the references taken from the
internet: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ M\% C3\%
A1\_of\_support\_vector).

\textbf{Adaboost:} is an Ensemble learning method of the Boosting type.
In industry, boost algorithms were used for the binary classification
problem of face detection, where the algorithm has to identify whether a
part of an image is a face or background follows the reference taken
from the internet: (https: // en .wikipedia.org / wiki / AdaBoost).

\textbf{When does it work well?}

\textbf{Gaussian Naive Bayes:} The strength of this model lies in its
simplicity inherited from the assumption that all the resources needed
to correctly classify data are "independent" from one another. This
allows the algorithm to be trained quickly and uses less data. Also,
even when the underlying assumption of independence is broken (that is,
when resources have relationships between them), this algorithm still
works very well and is able to rank based on the maximum probability of
a given label of the resource set and not on the actual probabilities of
each resource.

\textbf{Vector Support Machines (SVM):} This model is effective in high
dimensional spaces and more suitable for problems with complex domains,
where there are clear separation margins in the data. To correctly
classify the data, this model is also able to define complex
higher-order separation planes by means of custom kernels.

\textbf{Adaboost:} One of the main strengths of Adaboost is that it is a
fast algorithm, independent of the classifier and less prone to
overfitting. During iterative training, it continually gives more weight
to improperly labeled labels to allow the classifier to focus on the
more difficult cases, which increases overall model performance.

\textbf{What are the weaknesses of the model? When does it malfunction?}

\textbf{Gaussian Naive Bayes:} On the other hand, Naive Bayes' weakness
is that if it encounters an unprecedented combination of traits (in
which it has never been trained), it probably estimates the probability
as 0, which can cause it to misclassify the label.

\textbf{Vector Support Machines (SVM):} One of the weaknesses of this
model is that training can consume a lot of time on large data sets. In
addition, SVCs can perform poorly and excessively when data is too noisy
or overlaps.

\textbf{Adaboost:} On the other hand, noisy data and discrepant values
​​in the data can negatively impact performance, so data preprocessing
is important. In addition, if a complex model is used as the base
classifier, this can lead to overfitting of the training data.

\textbf{What makes this model a good candidate for the problem,
considering what you know about the data?}

\textbf{Gaussian Naive Bayes:} This particular model may be a good
approach to solving the problem because we have a large dataset with few
features.

\textbf{Vector Support Machines (SVM):} Although training in our large
current dataset can become a problem, the model may still be a good
candidate, as there seems to be some features in the data that can more
clearly define the boundary of the income level.

\textbf{Adaboost:} In my opinion, this model is a good candidate for the
problem because our dataset is large but clean. Therefore, we can
perform several quick training iterations to maximize our overall
accuracy in unseen test data.

    \subsubsection{Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting
Pipeline}\label{implementation---creating-a-training-and-predicting-pipeline}

To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's
important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows
you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of
training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your
implementation here will be used in the following section. In the code
block below, you will need to implement the following: - Import
\texttt{fbeta\_score} and \texttt{accuracy\_score} from
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html\#sklearn-metrics-metrics}{\texttt{sklearn.metrics}}.
- Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training
time. - Perform predictions on the test data \texttt{X\_test}, and also
on the first 300 training points \texttt{X\_train{[}:300{]}}. - Record
the total prediction time. - Calculate the accuracy score for both the
training subset and testing set. - Calculate the F-score for both the
training subset and testing set. - Make sure that you set the
\texttt{beta} parameter!

Evaluation}\label{implementation-initial-model-evaluation}

In the code cell, you will need to implement the following: - Import the
three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous
section. - Initialize the three models and store them in
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_A\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_B\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_C\textquotesingle{}}. - Use a

\texttt{\textquotesingle{}samples\_10\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}samples\_100\textquotesingle{}} respectively.

    \subsubsection{Question 3 - Choosing the Best
Model}\label{question-3---choosing-the-best-model}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two
  paragraphs, explain to \emph{CharityML} which of the three models you
  believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals
  that make more than \$50,000.
\end{itemize}

** HINT: ** Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the
visualization created by
\texttt{vs.evaluate(results,\ accuracy,\ fscore)}) and check the F score
for the testing set when 100\% of the training set is used. Which model
has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the: *
metrics - F score on the testing when 100\% of the training data is
used, * prediction/training time * the algorithm's suitability for the
data.

    \textbf{Answer:} According to my analysis, the most appropriate solution
to this problem would be achieved using the Adaboost ensemble model. As
can be seen in the plots, in comparison to the SVM, the Adaboost and
GaussianNB algorithms are able to train across the dataset and execute
predictions quickly. However, in all training set sizes, the training
and test accuracies achieved with Adaboost are significantly higher than
those obtained using the GuassianNB algorithm as simple and as high as
those obtained by the more complex SVC model. In addition, in terms of
Fbeta scores, Adaboost slightly outperforms the SVC in all training set
sizes and significantly outperforms the GaussianNB.

After verifying all the data plotted, it can be concluded that Adaboost
is the most suitable for this problem. In addition, since we are more
interested in maximizing the number of accurately ranked people who
produce more than 50K, this model, which has the highest accuracy, seems
to be the most appropriate.

    \subsubsection{Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's
Terms}\label{question-4---describing-the-model-in-laymans-terms}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In one to two paragraphs, explain to \emph{CharityML}, in layman's
  terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that
  you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the
  model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using
  advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.
\end{itemize}

** HINT: **

When explaining your model, if using external resources please include
all citations.

    \textbf{Answer:} Adaboost is an apprentice ensemble type of
reinforcement. This method works by combining several individual weak
learning hypotheses to create a stronger model. For each weak hypothesis
it is better to classify the data than chance is simply random. During
each training process, the model attempts to correctly classify training
data. Based on how well it was run during iteration, the algorithm
assigns larger weights to observations that could not be properly
sorted. In the next training process, the algorithm focuses on those
more complex observations, initially classified as unclassified, and
attempts to classify them correctly. Again, based on the results of this
training, the Adaboost algorithm assigns larger weights to the
observations that were classified incorrectly. This process is repeated
in several user-defined ways in an attempt to find the set of weighted
hypotheses that will perform best on unseen data. Finally, it develops
individual forecasts that are then weighted according to the strongest
prediction most likely.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Model
Tuning}\label{implementation-model-tuning}

Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (\texttt{GridSearchCV}) with
at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values.
You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell
below, you will need to implement the following: - Import
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html}{\texttt{sklearn.grid\_search.GridSearchCV}}
and
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html}{\texttt{sklearn.metrics.make\_scorer}}.
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in \texttt{clf}.
- Set a \texttt{random\_state} if one is available to the same state you
set before. - Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the
chosen model. - Example:
\texttt{parameters\ =\ \{\textquotesingle{}parameter\textquotesingle{}\ :\ {[}list\ of\ values{]}\}}.
- \textbf{Note:} Avoid tuning the \texttt{max\_features} parameter of
your learner if that parameter is available! - Use \texttt{make\_scorer}
to create an \texttt{fbeta\_score} scoring object (with
\(\beta = 0.5\)). - Perform grid search on the classifier \texttt{clf}
using the \texttt{\textquotesingle{}scorer\textquotesingle{}}, and store
it in \texttt{grid\_obj}. - Fit the grid search object to the training
data (\texttt{X\_train}, \texttt{y\_train}), and store it in
\texttt{grid\_fit}.

\textbf{Note:} Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list,
the following implementation may take some time to run!

\item
  What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing
  data?
\item
  Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model?
\item
  How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive

\subsection{Feature Importance}\label{feature-importance}

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like
the census data we study here is determining which features provide the
most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a
few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding
of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the
case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of
features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most
or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that
has a \texttt{feature\_importance\_} attribute, which is a function that
ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier. In
the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this
attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census
dataset.

    \subsubsection{Question 6 - Feature Relevance
Observation}\label{question-6---feature-relevance-observation}

When \textbf{Exploring the Data}, it was shown there are thirteen
available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of
these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most
important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

    \textbf{Answer:} According to the analysis, below is the data that
present better performances, already follow the order of execution:

\emph{Age:} younger people are generally less experienced than older
people and therefore also pay less.

\emph{Hours per week:} Assuming two people have the same hourly rate,
the one who works the most hours has the potential to make more money
and is more likely to be earning more than 50K.

\emph{Level of education:} people with higher education also have a
better chance of finding jobs with higher salaries

\emph{Work:} Working for the state or government does not always pay as
much as working in the private sector.

\emph{Native country:} People in first world countries, like the US,
tend to earn more income than in other countries. * Translate Google.com

    \subsubsection{Implementation - Extracting Feature
Importance}\label{implementation---extracting-feature-importance}

Choose a \texttt{scikit-learn} supervised learning algorithm that has a
\texttt{feature\_importance\_} attribute availble for it. This attribute
is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making
predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following: -
Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from
the three used earlier. - Train the supervised model on the entire
training set. - Extract the feature importances using
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}.feature\_importances\_\textquotesingle{}}.

    \subsubsection{Question 7 - Extracting Feature
Importance}\label{question-7---extracting-feature-importance}

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most
relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above
\$50,000.\\
* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed
in \textbf{Question 6}? * If you were close to the same answer, how does
this visualization confirm your thoughts? * If you were not close, why
do you think these features are more relevant?

    \textbf{Answer:} According to the data they were only partially certain.
However, capital gains and capital losses were not expected to play a
significant role. However, this algorithm gives these two
characteristics greater weights because their data probably contain
better indicators of people's income level, which helps the algorithm to
define a stronger and more precise decision boundary. On the other hand,
age, number of hours per week, and schooling were expected to be part of
the predictive traits of direction according to what was previously
answered. Taking into account that the data seems to have had no losses,
but its result was not satisfactory according to the fields mentioned
above in the answer. * Translate Google.com original em PTBR

    \subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}

How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available
features in the data? With less features required to train, the
expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower --- at
the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see
that the top five most important features contribute more than half of
the importance of \textbf{all} features present in the data. This hints
that we can attempt to \emph{reduce the feature space} and simplify the
information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will
use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same
training set \emph{with only the top five important features}.

    \subsubsection{Question 8 - Effects of Feature
Selection}\label{question-8---effects-of-feature-selection}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced
  data using only five features compare to those same scores when all
  features are used?
\item
  If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced
  data as your training set?
\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Answer:} Reducing data to only five features also reduces
F-score and prediction accuracy. I believe this is due to the fact that
the classifier is not able to accurately capture the complexity of the
data and therefore fails to generalize properly.

However, if training time was an important factor, reducing the number
of resources should reduce training time.

Furthermore, since the impact on accuracy and / or F-scores is not very
large, the small increase in misclassification could be an adequate
tradeoff in this scenario or similar scenarios. * Translate Google.com
